### Confirmation email

After filling out the registration form you will not receive an automatic
confirmation email immediately after filling out the form but you can expect to
receive a confirmation email from us within a week. The reason for this is
that we typically have more people interested in the course than we have seats.


### Waiting list

We maintain a waiting list for seats but this is currently not automatic so we
need this short time buffer to manually confirm participants and inform those who
are on the waiting list.


### First come, first serve

The seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis but we need to also
make sure that registered participants are affiliated with a Nordic academic
institution since the course is free for participants and financed by the
Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration.


### Cancellation

We ask confirmed participants who are not able to participate at the course
they have signed up for, to inform us as soon as possible so that people on the
waiting list can take the vacant seat.


### Questions?

If you have any questions about your registration status, please write to
[Radovan Bast](mailto:radovan.bast@uit.no).
