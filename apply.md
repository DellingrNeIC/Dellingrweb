  The Dellingr project aims at offering an easy and immediate access to Nordic e-Infrastructure for small research
projects. Small research projects are projects that require up to 50k CPU/5k GPU core hours over a 6 month period.
Access request and usage monitoring is done in Dellingr <a href="https://share.neic.no/">self-service platform</a>.

Please follow <a href="/guide/">instructions</a> to apply! The list of available resource
providers along with links ot the terms of services is provided in the self-service.
