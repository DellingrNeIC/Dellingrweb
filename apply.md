## Hello!

We are happy to announce the a new round of testing of the cross-border resource sharing service by Dellingr project.

The Dellingr project aims at offering an easy and immediate access to Nordic e-Infrastructure for small research
projects. Small research projects are projects that require up to 100k CPU/10k GPU core hours over a 6 month period.


Access request and usage monitoring is done in Dellingr [self-service platform](https://share.neic.no/).

**Please follow [instructions](/guide/#getting-resources-via-dellingr) to apply! The list of available resource
providers along with links ot the terms of services is provided in the self-service.**
