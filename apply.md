The Dellingr project aims at offering an easy and immediate access to Nordic e-Infrastructure for small resource
projects. Small resource projects are projects that require a small volume of resources for a limited period,
like a few hundred thousand CPU core hours over a 3-4 month time period. The idea is to provide access to Nordic
Infrastructure resources for emerging research projects.

Work performed with the aid of resources obtained through this pilot may be acknowledged by:
"This work was made possible (in part) by usage of computing resources at (institution) through the
NeIC Dellingr resource sharing pilot." (or similar).

A summary of the applications served by the first pilot can be found
