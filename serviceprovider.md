## Virtual Allocation Committee

Virtual Allocation Committee (VAC) is processing requests of the user and filling the gap between
user requirements, service providers' capabilities and requirements.

VAC is intended to be replaced with automated transactions in the mid term based on formal requirements, till
then user requests are creating ServiceDesk issues with all required information.

Migration to automated flow does not cause any changes from the user perspective, only delivery speed goes up.
